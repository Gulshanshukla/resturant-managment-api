- `Application.java`: The main application class.
- `src/main/resources/`:

application.properties: Configuration file for database settings and other application properties.
***

### user Endpoints (UserController):
- `GET /employees`: Get all employees.

Example Request (Create an Employee):

POST http://localhost:8080/employees
Content-Type: application/json
```json

{
    "firstName": "John",
    "lastName": "Doe",
    "address": {
        "street": "123 Main St",
        "city": "Springfield",
        "state": "IL",
        "zipcode": "12345"
    }
}
   

 ```
